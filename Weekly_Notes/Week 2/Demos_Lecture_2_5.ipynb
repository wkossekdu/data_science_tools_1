      "Early explorers had named the bridges for members of their parties or\n",

      "                      How Natural Bridges Are Made\n",
      "\n",
      "To make a natural bridge Mother Nature must have several ingredients: a\n",
      "proper stone that will shape well (a cross-bedded sandstone is best), a\n",
      "slowly rising landscape, and a desert-type stream that occasionally will\n",
      "scour its bed with a tremendous head of water and sand. All these were\n",
      "present in southern Utah.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stone of the Natural Bridges area is a cross-bedded grey sandstone,\n",
      "known as the Cedar Mesa sandstone. It is of Permian age and similar in\n",
      "appearance and structure to the more recent Navajo sandstone in which so\n",
      "many caves and arches have been formed.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the land began to rise slowly from its ancient sea bed, two small\n",
      "streams formed on the western slopes of the Elk Ridge. The streams are\n",
      "known today as White River and Armstrong Creek, its tributary. They made\n",
      "meandering channels across the flat land and gradually entrenched\n",
      "themselves into tortuous canyons. As the land continued to rise, the\n",
      "streams cut ever deeper canyons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main purpose, or the driving force, of a stream is to make the\n",
      "shortest distance between two points, that is, a straight line. Every\n",
      "creek and river attempts to make a straight channel with an even grade\n",
      "from its source to its mouth. Hills, ridges, blocks of rock, or any\n",
      "other obstacles which a stream must bypass are gradually worn away as\n",
      "the stream makes a channel more to its choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tortuous streams in their deep rock channels were constantly trying\n",
      "to straighten their courses. During floods the silt-laden waters were\n",
      "thrown with great force against the walls of the meanders. In several\n",
      "places the fins of rock around which the windings of the streams passed\n",
      "were so thin that during the course of many centuries of buffeting the\n",
      "rock gradually wore away and a hole was bored through the fin. The\n",
      "waters poured through the gap and the bridge was born. After the initial\n",
      "breach was made, the stream continued to enlarge the opening and to cut\n",
      "its channel still deeper. Eventually, the old meander was left high and\n",
      "dry as a “fossil” stream bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "                          Ages of the Bridges\n",
      "\n",
      "Several phases of bridge-making may be seen at Natural Bridges National\n",
      "Monument.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kachina Bridge is a new bridge. It is huge and bulky, and has a\n",
      "comparatively small opening. White River is still actively enlarging the\n",
      "opening beneath the span.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sipapu Bridge is mature. It is a graceful, symmetrical span, and its\n",
      "abutments now lie far enough from the stream bed that the river has\n",
      "little or no cutting action on the rock.\n",
      "\n",
      "    [Illustration: _Sipapu Bridge, looking up White Canyon._]\n",
      "\n",
      "Owachomo Bridge is in its old age. It suffers no erosion from the\n",
      "stream; only the slight erosion from rains, frost action, or wind-blown\n",
      "sands now attack its surface. The life expectancy of Owachomo is short\n",
      "compared with that of the other two; it may span the canyon for\n",
      "centuries yet, or the crack which will ultimately cause its collapse may\n",
      "already have started.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fate of all the bridges may be seen a short distance up White Canyon\n",
      "from Sipapu Bridge where faint scars and damaged abutments on the canyon\n",
      "walls indicate the point where a fourth bridge once spanned the canyon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "             Comparison With Other Types of Natural Bridges\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the natural bridges of the United States are in the Four Corners\n",
      "region of the Southwest where favorable materials and conditions for\n",
      "bridge-making are to be found. There are two other types of bridges\n",
      "which are entirely dissimilar. Tonto Natural Bridge, in central Arizona,\n",
      "is a “built-up” bridge created by travertine deposited by springs.\n",
      "Natural Bridge, in Virginia—another well-known bridge—apparently was\n",
      "formed when most of the roof of a cavern collapsed.\n",

      "                                Wildlife\n",
      "\n",
      "Deer are numerous in the pinyon and juniper forest which surrounds the\n",
      "monument, and mountain sheep, which spend their summers on the Elk\n",
      "Ridge, winter in the canyons. Smaller mammals are numerous, as are the\n",
      "coyotes and wildcats. An occasional lion works through the monument.\n",

      "                               Archeology\n",
      "\n",
      "This section of Utah supported an Indian population from about 2,000\n",
      "years ago until about A. D. 1300. Thousands of ruins stud the mesas and\n",
      "canyons of the district. Comparatively few sites lie within the\n",
      "monument, however, for both White and Armstrong Canyons are too narrow\n",
      "to have furnished enough farming land for more than a few families.\n",
      "\n",
      "Visitors who hike around the trail to the bridges may see one cliff\n",
      "dwelling of about 20 rooms and several small rooms (apparently\n",
      "granaries) which were built on ledges high on the cliffs. An outstanding\n",
      "feature of the cliff dwelling is a kiva, or ceremonial room, with the\n",
      "original roof and ladder intact. The people who lived here during\n",
      "prehistoric times were closely related to those who lived on the Mesa\n",

      "Early explorers had named the bridges for members of their parties or\n",

      "live in the country, had no names for the individual bridges. At the\n",

      "                      How Natural Bridges Are Made\n",
      "\n",
      "To make a natural bridge Mother Nature must have several ingredients: a\n",
      "proper stone that will shape well (a cross-bedded sandstone is best), a\n",
      "slowly rising landscape, and a desert-type stream that occasionally will\n",
      "scour its bed with a tremendous head of water and sand. All these were\n",
      "present in southern Utah.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stone of the Natural Bridges area is a cross-bedded grey sandstone,\n",
      "known as the Cedar Mesa sandstone. It is of Permian age and similar in\n",
      "appearance and structure to the more recent Navajo sandstone in which so\n",
      "many caves and arches have been formed.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the land began to rise slowly from its ancient sea bed, two small\n",
      "streams formed on the western slopes of the Elk Ridge. The streams are\n",
      "known today as White River and Armstrong Creek, its tributary. They made\n",
      "meandering channels across the flat land and gradually entrenched\n",
      "themselves into tortuous canyons. As the land continued to rise, the\n",
      "streams cut ever deeper canyons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main purpose, or the driving force, of a stream is to make the\n",
      "shortest distance between two points, that is, a straight line. Every\n",
      "creek and river attempts to make a straight channel with an even grade\n",
      "from its source to its mouth. Hills, ridges, blocks of rock, or any\n",
      "other obstacles which a stream must bypass are gradually worn away as\n",
      "the stream makes a channel more to its choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tortuous streams in their deep rock channels were constantly trying\n",
      "to straighten their courses. During floods the silt-laden waters were\n",
      "thrown with great force against the walls of the meanders. In several\n",
      "places the fins of rock around which the windings of the streams passed\n",
      "were so thin that during the course of many centuries of buffeting the\n",
      "rock gradually wore away and a hole was bored through the fin. The\n",
      "waters poured through the gap and the bridge was born. After the initial\n",
      "breach was made, the stream continued to enlarge the opening and to cut\n",
      "its channel still deeper. Eventually, the old meander was left high and\n",
      "dry as a “fossil” stream bed.\n",

      "                          Ages of the Bridges\n",

      "Several phases of bridge-making may be seen at Natural Bridges National\n",
      "Monument.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kachina Bridge is a new bridge. It is huge and bulky, and has a\n",
      "comparatively small opening. White River is still actively enlarging the\n",
      "opening beneath the span.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sipapu Bridge is mature. It is a graceful, symmetrical span, and its\n",
      "abutments now lie far enough from the stream bed that the river has\n",
      "little or no cutting action on the rock.\n",
      "\n",
      "    [Illustration: _Sipapu Bridge, looking up White Canyon._]\n",
      "\n",
      "Owachomo Bridge is in its old age. It suffers no erosion from the\n",
      "stream; only the slight erosion from rains, frost action, or wind-blown\n",
      "sands now attack its surface. The life expectancy of Owachomo is short\n",
      "compared with that of the other two; it may span the canyon for\n",
      "centuries yet, or the crack which will ultimately cause its collapse may\n",
      "already have started.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fate of all the bridges may be seen a short distance up White Canyon\n",
      "from Sipapu Bridge where faint scars and damaged abutments on the canyon\n",
      "walls indicate the point where a fourth bridge once spanned the canyon.\n",

      "             Comparison With Other Types of Natural Bridges\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the natural bridges of the United States are in the Four Corners\n",
      "region of the Southwest where favorable materials and conditions for\n",
      "bridge-making are to be found. There are two other types of bridges\n",
      "which are entirely dissimilar. Tonto Natural Bridge, in central Arizona,\n",
      "is a “built-up” bridge created by travertine deposited by springs.\n",
      "Natural Bridge, in Virginia—another well-known bridge—apparently was\n",
      "formed when most of the roof of a cavern collapsed.\n",

      "monument, and mountain sheep, which spend their summers on the Elk\n",
      "Ridge, winter in the canyons. Smaller mammals are numerous, as are the\n",

      "years ago until about A. D. 1300. Thousands of ruins stud the mesas and\n",

      "Visitors who hike around the trail to the bridges may see one cliff\n",
      "dwelling of about 20 rooms and several small rooms (apparently\n",
      "granaries) which were built on ledges high on the cliffs. An outstanding\n",
      "feature of the cliff dwelling is a kiva, or ceremonial room, with the\n",
      "original roof and ladder intact. The people who lived here during\n",
