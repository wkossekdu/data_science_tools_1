#Median calculation

#Q4(2=1(taking care of even number of frequencies)+1 points(right value of median)). Using sorted_words,
#write code for median frequency value calculation. Print the value of the median with an echo statement, stating
# it is a median value.
#Code must check even or odd  number of unique words. For even case median is the mean of middle two values,
#for the odd case, it is middle value in sorted items.






# Mean value calculation
#Q5(1 point) Using for loop, write code to update count variable: total number of unique words
#Q6(1 point) Using for loop, write code to update total_freq variable : sum of frequencies
total_freq=0
count=0



#Q7(1 point) Write code to calculate mean frequency value based on total_freq and count

echo "Total unique words = $count"

#Q8(1 point) Using bc -l command, calculate mean value.
# Write your code after = 
echo "Mean frequency using floating point arithemetics =  "



# Q9 (1 point) Complete lazy_commit bash function(look for how to write bash functions) to add, commit and push to the remote master.
# In the command prompt, this function is used as
#
# lazygit file_1 file_2 ... file_n commit_message
#
# This bash function must take files name and commit message as positional parameters
# and perform followling git function
#
# git add file_1 file_2 .. file_n
# git commit -m commit_message
# git push origin master

#
# Side: In the Linux if we put this function in .bashrc hidden file in
# the user home directory(type cd ~ to go to the home directory) and source .bashrc after adding this function,
# lazy_commit should be available in the command prompt.
# One can type lazy_commit file1 file2 ... filen  commit_message
# and file will be added , commited and pushed to remote master using one lazy_commit command.
